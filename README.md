# ImageInserterIntoHTML
A program makes easy to add too many img HTML tags.
You can use this simple program to prepare HTML codes for manga pages.

# Why did I make this?
I like translating mangas and webtoons from English to Turkish. Then I publish them on my website. But everytime I have to add commands like "\<img src='1.jpg'>".

And the src should go like "1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, 4.jpg ...". As you see writing these file names takes a lifetime (because a manga or webtoon chapter generally has pages more than 30-40). So I made this program. Thanks to that now I can prepare codes in a few seconds no matter how many pages.
